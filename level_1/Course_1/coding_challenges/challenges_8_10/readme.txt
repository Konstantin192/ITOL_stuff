Challenge 8
Challenge: Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Foundation to build a webpage.

Requirements: Explore the features of the chosen framework to create a responsive and visually appealing webpage. Customize the design as needed.

Note: Used Tailwind. Gradually lost patience with it and started using more and more regular CSS as Tailwind gradually stopped applying things as basic as width/height sizing or background colors.
