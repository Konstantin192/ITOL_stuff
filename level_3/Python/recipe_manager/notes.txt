Recipe data structure Class VS Dictionary
Class structure would allow for better encapsulation as all functionality relating to a recipe would be contained
within the class. With a Dictionary structure there would have to be a separate recipe utils file that contains all the
functionality.

Recipe details data types
Ingredients - String vs Array vs List
Instructions - String vs Array vs List

Editing recipe ingredients
Ask "Yes" or "No" after every edit if the user wishes to continue editing ingredients - can be annoying if editing
multiple ingredients but makes more sense from an end user standpoint
OR
Require the user to enter "0" after they are done with their edits - not annoying when editing multiple ingredients but
can feel a bit odd from an end user standpoint
